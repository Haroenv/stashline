# StashLine

StashLine is an IOS app for long term personal finance planning and simulation.
For me it was a challenge to make something that was polished, complete, visually appealing and well designed. Not to mention that I wanted it as a useful tool for myself. It's been reasonably popular with around 7500 lifetime downloads.

Check out the [StashLine website](http://thume.ca/stashline/) for much more information. You can also check it out on the IOS app store.

It's not actively developed anymore because I consider it fairly complete. I might update it if an IOS update ever breaks it.

If StashLine interests you, check out my other financial visualization project [IndexView](http://thume.ca/indexView/).
